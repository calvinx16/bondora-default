# Bondora Default Risk Predictor

A simple machine learning project to predict loan defaults using data from Bondora, a European peer-to-peer lending platform.

Originally developed during a Fintech seminar in 2022 as part of my undergraduate coursework, this repo demonstrates the core steps of a classification problem â€” from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model evaluation.

> Note: The project currently relies on local data files not included in the repo. Maybe in the future I will revisit to try to add back old data files or even try out more recent data :)
## Goals
- Clean and preprocess loan application data
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate a logistic regression model
